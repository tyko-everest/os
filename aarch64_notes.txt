Exceptions:

Table desc - p. 134 of DEN0024A_v8_architecture_PG.pdf

The choice of stack pointer is indicated by the letter t or h appended to the exception level name,
for example EL0t or EL3h. The t suffix indicates that the exception level uses SP_EL0 and the h suffix indicates it uses SP_ELx,
where x is the current exception level number. EL0 always uses SP_EL0 so cannot have an h suffix.
